        </section>
        <article class="about-me-description"> Hi, my name is Kevin McAmis, and I'm new to web devlopment. I'm currently learning from Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree, and then plan on taking their Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree to learn more about the backend lanuages that run the web, while refining my front-end skills. From there I plan on taking Udacity's Mobile Web Specialist, React, and Design Sprint Foundations Nanodegrees. I plan on taking these Nanodegrees, so I can learn how to build even better responsive sites that work well on mobile, how to build highly interactive, responsive, and data-driven user intertfaces with React, and then how to more efficently take an idea from being theoretical, to refining the idea, and then creating a prototype program or design, before moving on to user testing to finalize the design. As a result of taking the time to learn form these differnet Nanodegrees, I plan on becoming a well rounded Full Stack Web Developer that can be benefical to my colleges, at any stage of the web development process.
